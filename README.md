üéµ Spotify SQL Project

This project demonstrates SQL-based data exploration, analysis, and optimization on a dataset containing Spotify and YouTube music statistics. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), answer business-related queries, and showcase query optimization techniques.

üìÇ Project Structure

sql_project.sql ‚Üí Main SQL script containing:

Table creation

Data cleaning queries

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Business problem-solving queries

Query optimization (with and without indexes)

üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

Table: spotify

Column	Type	Description
artist	VARCHAR	Artist name
track	VARCHAR	Track name
album	VARCHAR	Album name
album_type	VARCHAR	Album type (album / single / compilation)
danceability	FLOAT	Danceability score
energy	FLOAT	Energy score
loudness	FLOAT	Loudness (db)
speechiness	FLOAT	Speechiness score
acousticness	FLOAT	Acousticness score
instrumentalness	FLOAT	Instrumentalness score
liveness	FLOAT	Liveness score
valence	FLOAT	Positiveness of track
tempo	FLOAT	Tempo (BPM)
duration_min	FLOAT	Duration in minutes
title	VARCHAR	Video/Track title
channel	VARCHAR	YouTube channel
views	FLOAT	Views on YouTube
likes	BIGINT	Number of likes
comments	BIGINT	Number of comments
licensed	BOOLEAN	Whether track is licensed
official_video	BOOLEAN	Whether official video exists
stream	BIGINT	Total Spotify streams
energy_liveness	FLOAT	Energy-to-liveness ratio
most_played_on	VARCHAR	Platform with most streams (Spotify / YouTube)
üîé Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Some example EDA queries include:

Counting total tracks, artists, and albums

Checking track durations and removing invalid values

Identifying most viewed songs and popular platforms

Exploring distinct album types and channels

üí° Business Problem Queries

The project answers multiple business-driven queries, such as:

Tracks with more than 1B streams

Albums with respective artists

Total comments for licensed tracks

Top 5 tracks with highest energy values

Average danceability per album

Most-viewed tracks per artist (using window functions)

Tracks streamed more on Spotify vs YouTube

Energy-to-liveness ratio analysis

‚ö° Query Optimization

To demonstrate performance improvements, queries are compared:

Without Index: Slower execution

With Index (artist_index): Optimized execution

Example:

-- Without index
SELECT artist, track, views 
FROM spotify
WHERE artist = 'Gorillaz'
ORDER BY views DESC;

-- With index
CREATE INDEX artist_index ON spotify(artist);

üöÄ How to Use

Import the sql_project.sql file into your SQL environment (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

Execute the table creation script to set up the schema.

Load the dataset (not included in this repo, placeholder table created).

Run EDA queries to explore the dataset.

Test business problem queries for insights.

Compare query performance with and without indexes.

üìä Key Insights

Dataset contains 20,592 tracks after cleaning.

2,074 unique artists and 11,854 albums.

Luis Fonsi‚Äôs Despacito is the most viewed track.

Over 385 tracks have 1B+ streams.

Spotify dominates streaming for 15,692 tracks.
